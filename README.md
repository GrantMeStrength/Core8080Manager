# 8080CoreManager

An app for creating, editing and assembling 8080 source code files.

## Overview

This project builds on the GitHub project [8080Core](https://github.com/GrantMeStrength/core8080), which contains the Assembler, and the [Document Browser sample](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_controllers/building_a_document_browser-based_app) that Apple publish. The result is an app that can create, load and safe files of type .s, and assemble them into hex and octal.
